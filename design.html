      <p>This is a collection of media and side projects that I have
      participated in over the past few years. It includes videos from two
      d.school classes I took Spring Quarter of my Junior year,
      which involved making many videos explaining design
      decisions. These never became fully implemented projects, but I thought
      they would be cool to collect and share the videos and some
      explanations of our design ideas.</p><br>

  <b>Coffee Break</b> <br /><em>Udacity</em><br />
  I did an interview for Udacity's new series of classes about my
  experience learning programming to demonstrate how CS concepts learned
  in classes can be put to use in real applications.

    I was a Panalist at the 2012 She++ Conference and have since acted as

    this one

    <b>Z Patch</b><br /><em>Creativity</em><br />
    Prompt: Redesign the sleep experience
    Solution: College Students need a better way of managing their time
    and turning socially or educationally unproductive time into
    sleep. Our solution monitors brain waves to diagnose when productivity
    is dropping and nudge the user towards sleep instead of procrastination.

    <b>Scholastic Book Fair</b><br /><em>Play</em><br />
    Prompt: Redesign the Scholastic Book Fair
    Solution: Incorporate a book drive into the book fair event so that
    underprivaledged students have an opportunity to purchase discounted
    books. Also, add a voucher system so that teachers can offset need by
    rewarding high-performing or economically-struggling students with
    tickets to be used to purchase books at the fair.

    <b>The Presidential Games</b><br /><em>Play</em><br />
    Prompt: Redesign the voting experience
    Solution: Citizens miss the opportunity to vote because they are
    uneducated and unwilling to make the effort to become educated. Our
    solution is like a Hunger Games or American Idol for voting where
    candidates compete on a number of tasks testing leadership skills,
    intelligence, and other skills desirable in a president. The public is
    engaged by the tv-show, thereby becoming educated and creating a
    social pressure to engage in voting.

    <b>ShoeTunes</b><br /><em>Play</em><br />
    Prompt: How might people have more fun in their Vans?<br />
    Solution: Introverts need a better way to connect with themselves and
    the people around them through physical play. Our ShoeTune accessory
    lets the wearer sync their music to their movements, or have our
    iPhone app machine learn common sound effects for repetitive
    motions. Our accessory is equipped with a gyroscope and accelerometer
    and can be used by an individual to inspire personal introspection or
    by a group to create a creative song through physical play, thereby
    connecting the group.

    <b>Clipper's Hair Cuts</b><br /><em>Creativity</em><br />
    Prompt: Redisign the Hair Cut Experience
    Solution: Create a hair club with a subscription model where people
    can relax while getting however frequent haircuts they need. This
    turns hair cutting from being a chore into a lesiure, social activity.
