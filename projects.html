    I worked on a team of four as the Design and Research Lead to create
    a web application designed to help Stanford students navigate their
    options after college by providing them with a portal to connect with
    more experienced students. Our project involved designing,
    researching, and implementing a Django/Python based website that
    allows Stanford students to browse and contact like-minded
    alumni. Cardinal Direction helps
    students make meaningful, in-person connections and visualize where
    other Stanford CS students go after graduation to get
    inspiration.

We shadowed two divisions of the Coast Guard: Air and Sea, and gathered observation "nuggets". One of our main insights was that the Coast Guard needs to prepare for potential failures by creating Plan Bs and executing them in the field.

     My friend <a href="http://www.rioakasaka.com/">Rio Akasaka</a> and I developed and studied a tool for
     encouraging synchronous online collaboration. We wanted to 
     visualize when an individual was actively working on a collaborative
     task, and communicate that to their partner(s). We hypothesized that 
     individuals would collaborate
     better when they could interact in real time, even if not in
     person. We noticed during our study that once we made the time
     contribution visible, the two partners put in almost exactly the same
     time commitment to the project. We wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPyVmaOgYoO0BLKi8z2YsPn3rk2ISI0c3yjF20jWYYU/edit?authkey=CI3yqeMF">paper</a>
